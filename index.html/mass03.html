        <h1>Learning how to create using html</h1>
        <p>I started a couple of days ago, learning from freecodecamp tutorials.</p>
        <p> <strong>My daily schedule</strong>:
            <br>&nbsp;...I learn more about web development.
            <br>...I plan my schedule.
            <br>...I use resources from <abbr title="Mozilla developer network">MDN</abbr> 
        </p>

        <h2>learning javascript is challenging</h2>
        <P>It needs constant practise, I thought it would be an easy tool to learn</P>
        <p>that was not entirely true as time passes I realise I have to put more time</p>
        <p>and work towards me attaining the skills and knowledge to use the tool.</p>
        <P>having goals set can be helpful, I cannot do all in one day</P>
        <p>but knowing you gaining a thing or two everyday builds confidence within yourself.</p>

        <h2>I forsee myself being a full stack developer</h2>
        <P>I still need to learn all <em>front end </em> and <em>back-end </em> language tools</P>
        <p>In six months time I should have learnt and understood most things I need to learn</p>
        <P>By december i should be elligle to acquire a job as a junior fullstack software developer.</P>
